#Morgan (HTTP Request Logger):
   Purpose: Morgan is a middleware for logging HTTP requests in Node.js applications.
   Predefined formats: Provides several built-in logging formats like combined, common, dev, short, and tiny.
   Custom formats: Allows you to define custom log formats using tokens like :method, :url, :status, and :response-time.
   Integration with logging libraries: Can be integrated with other logging libraries like Winston for more advanced log handling.
   Performance impact: Lightweight and efficient, but logging increases the I/O overhead, so it's typically used in development or with reduced verbosity in production.
   Stream support: Allows redirecting log output to various streams (e.g., files, external logging services) for better log management.
#Winston (Logging Library):
   Purpose: Winston is a versatile logging library for Node.js applications, providing powerful logging capabilities.
   Multiple transports: Supports various transport mechanisms for logging (e.g., console, file, HTTP, database). You can log to multiple locations simultaneously.
   Log levels: Supports different log levels like info, error, warn, debug, which can be configured based on the environment.
   Custom formats: Allows you to define custom formats for your logs (e.g., timestamps, log levels, structured JSON).
   Integration: Can be integrated with other libraries (like Morgan) for HTTP request logging or with external services (e.g., log management platforms like Loggly, Elasticsearch).
   Asynchronous logging: Handles asynchronous logging efficiently, ensuring that logs are written without blocking the application.
   Error handling: Has features to log uncaught exceptions or unhandled promise rejections, useful for monitoring production systems.
